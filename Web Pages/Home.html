		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>This website was designed in the application Notepad++ with

		<p>Web Design and Construction is rather easy to get to grips 
		with however, the material it covers is quite vast as there are 
		many mark-up languages that can be utilised in order to create 
		a website and they all have their own distinct functionality as 
		well as their own rules that must be followed in order to create 
		a website that is not only functional but, one that that can be 
		used professionally. Conforming to these rules is also important 
		in order to ensure that any potential developers have the ability 
		to modify the site thus, suiting their needs without 'breaking' 
		the site and causing them to have to start from scratch.</p>
