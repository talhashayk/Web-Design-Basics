		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Often abbreviated as JS, JavaScript is not actually a 
		programming language like Java and for that matter it was 
		not even developed by the same people. It is in actuality 
		a scripting language or a "client-side" programming 
		language. The code is utilised much like a programming 
		language however, it is read, interpreted and executed by 
		the web browser in order to control the behaviour of 
		different elements. It is used in conjunction to HTML and 
		CSS in order to create fully functional websites.</p>

		<h2>Example</h2>
		<p>The alert quiz that you experienced when selecting the
		sub-page shows only a very small fraction of the power that
		JavaScript has. In order to create that the html code 
		requires a link to the JavaScript code.</p>
		<img class="examples imagecenter" src = "./Images/JavaScriptEG1.png" alt = "" width = 500 title = "Input Location">
		<p>The above code depicts how the script should be linked to
		the html code. It depicts the link in the form of a "script" 
		tag. It is placed in the head of the code however, if wanted 
		in only certain sections of the code, it can be placed inline 
		throughout the body. </p>
		<img class="examples imagecenter" src = "./Images/JavaScriptEG2.png" alt = "" width = 600 title = "JavaScript Array">
		<p>This shows the actual script that is provided 
		via the link in the html head for this website and shows how
		the quiz taken at the beginning actually works. To begin with
		there is an array of questions that holds both the questions 
		and their corresponding answers.</p>
		<img class="examples imagecenter" src = "./Images/JavaScriptEG3.png" alt = "" width = 600 title = "JavaScript For Loop">
		<p>This is the for loop used in order to calculate the score.
		Each time the correct answer is provided, the score variable 
		is incremented and the player is given an alert as to whether
		they were right or wrong. Finally, the player is presented with 
		their final score and are allowed to continue on with the rest 
		of the website.</p>
