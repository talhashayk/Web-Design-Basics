		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is the 
		standard mark-up language that is used when creating 
		a new website. The acronym HTML stands for:</p>
		<div>
			<ul class="listed">
					<li class="lists">H - Hyper</li>
					<li class="lists">T - Text</li>
					<li class="lists">M - Markup</li>
					<li class="lists">L - Language</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Its implementation is quite basic as it is used to describe 
		the general structure of Web pages. It utilises elements that 
		are represented by tags as the building blocks of the site. 
		There are many versions of HTML and the latest version of it 
		happens to be HTML5 which was released in the year 2012.</p>

	</div>
	<div id='Basics'>
		<h2>Basics</h2>
		<p>HTML code for a webpage is mainly comprised of 2 major 
		sections. These sections are the head and the body of the 
		code. The head holds the link to any relating style sheet 
		as well as the title and character set of the web page. 
		The body holds the actual code that constructs the web page 
		and is thus the main bulk of the code.</p>
		<img class="examples imagecenter" src = "./Images/basic.png" alt = "" height = 250 title = "Basic Tags">
		<hr>
	</div>
	<div id='Tags'>
		<h2>Tags</h2>
		<p>Tags are utilised to indicate the start and finish of a 
		HTML element. They come in many variations and are thus, 
		incredibly useful. There are tags to indicate the placement 
		of an image, the location of a link, the start of a paragraph, 
		many forms of headings... Evidently, this shows that there is 
		a vast amount of tags and some of the basic tags will be listed
		below as well as how they work.</p>
		<img class="examples imagecenter" src = "./Images/tags.jpg" alt = "" height = 500 title = "Tags">
		<hr>
	</div>
	<div id='Validation'>
		<h2>Validation</h2>
		<p>Validation methods are used in order to ensure that the 
		maintenance and modification of code is possible without any 
		serious issues. As well as this it also is used to ensure the 
		developer does not utilise any deprecated code within the 
		creation of their web page.</p>
		<img class="examples imagecenter" src = "./Images/W3C.png" alt = "" height = 250 title = "World Wide Web Consortium">
		<p>A commonly used validator tends to be the site 
		<a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C</a> 
		and this site not only informs the user of warnings and errors 
		but it also provides descriptions of what they are thus, 
		ensuring that their removal is done correctly and doesn't cause 
		any further errors.</p>
