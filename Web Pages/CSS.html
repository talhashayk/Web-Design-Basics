		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>CSS is a style sheet language that is utilised along side 
		mark-up language, generally html, in order to dictate how a 
		web page looks, is composed and reacts. the acronym CSS stands 
		for:</p>
		<ul class="listed">
				<li class="lists">C - Cascading</li>
				<li class="lists">S - Style</li>
				<li class="lists">S - Sheet</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Unlike CSS, its implementation is not so basic as it 
		requires hierarchy-based code and each element of code will 
		definitely be affected by other elements. As well as this the
		functionality of CSS is rather vast and thus, contains a lot 
		of material for a web developer to learn and gain experience 
		with.</p>
		<hr>
	</div>
	<div id='Hierarchy'>
		<h2>Hierarchy</h2>
		<p>The three main elements within the CSS hierarchy are tags,
		classes and IDs. They are also present in that order with 
		IDs being at the top of the pyramid and tags being at the 
		bottom of it.</p>
		<div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="imagecenter">Tags</h3>
				<p>Tags refer to the elements within html themselves. 
				It's use tends to be directed at a broader range of 
				similar elements in order to maintain consistency  
				throughout the web page.</p>
			</div>
			<img class="arrows imagecenter" src = "./Images/arrow.png" alt = "" height = 50 title = "">
			<div>
				<h3 class="imagecenter">Classes</h3>
				<p>Classes tend to be utilised when grouping certain 
				elements together in order to create a more specific 
				aesthetic or behaviour for that respective group. it 
				can be used in conjunction with tags however its 
				importance is regarded to as higher and thus will take
				precedent over tags.</p>
			</div>
			<img class="arrows imagecenter" src = "./Images/arrow.png" alt = "" height = 50 title = "">
			<div>
				<h3 class="imagecenter">IDs</h3>
				<p>IDs aren't always used as their requirement must be 
				absolutely necessary in order for their use. They are 
				given the highest position within the hierarchy and are 
				thus invoked over both tags and classes however, they 
				too can be used in conjunction in order to apply to 
				very specific elements and their behaviour.</p>
			</div>
		<hr>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div id='Colour_and_Text'>
		<h2>Colour and Text</h2>
		<p>Colour an text tend to be the most generally related 
		descriptors that people associate with CSS. This is due 
		to the fact that CSS is mostly used to influence the 
		aesthetic  of a website. The large part of a web pages 
		aesthetic is credited to the colours and text and thus,
		its association is not unrequited.</p>
		<div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="imagecenter">Colours</h3>
				<p>There are two manners in which colour is used. 
				The background colour which is utilised in order 
				to set the backing of a page or a certain devisor 
				thus allowing the user to differentiate between 
				elements. The other form of colour is the 
				foreground  colour which is utilised in order to 
				recolour text without the use of html in a manner 
				that is more professional as the using html for 
				this purpose is deprecated.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3 class="imagecenter">Text</h3>
				<p>Text has a lot on influence on a web page. Due 
				to this, there are many related functions that can
				alter text size, font, alignment  and even decorate 
				them in some form.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="imagecenter">
				<img class="examples" src = "./Images/example-page.jpg" alt = "" height = 250 title = "Example Web Page">
				<p>An example of a colour consistent and aesthetically 
				pleasing web page - Facebook</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<hr>
	</div>
	<div id='Composition'>
		<h2>Composition</h2>
		<p>Composition is a major factor in terms of CSS as it is 
		what enables a web page to look as it does and thus allows, 
		the user of the website to navigate and differentiate 
		between the many encompassing elements.</p>
		<img class="examples imagecenter" src = "./Images/boxmodel-image.jpg" alt = "" height = 300 title = "The Box Model">
		<p>CSS utilises 'the box model' in order to order and place 
		objects throughout the site as well as ensure the developer 
		is able to correctly manipulate objects. The hierarchy that 
		the box model follows is as such:</p>
		<ul class="prolist imagecenter">
			<li>Content</li>
			<li>Padding</li>
			<li>Border</li>
			<li>Margin</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Different levels of each modifier can be added to any side 
		of the content and thus, they can be used to relocate images 
		and text throughout the site. As well as the box model, there 
		are modifiers such as position and float which allow the 
		developer to determine where the content is placed and how it 
		behaves in relation to other content within the web page.</p>
